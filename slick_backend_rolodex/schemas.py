# First we create a BaseModel class

# our API will work.

# First we define what data a Contact needs to know in order 
# to properly create it. Thankfully, everything within 
# The base class contains all the data needed to make a Contact.
# We don't provide an Id or userId as the Id will be returned, and the 
# userId will be parsed from the href, 
# /user/{id}/contact 
class ContactCreate(ContactBase):

# Next we need to define what kind of data will come back 
# When we read. We want to include the id of contact 
# and the owner's id of the contact when we return.
